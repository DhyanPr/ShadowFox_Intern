OBJECTIVE:-
To analyze the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi by identifying key pollutants, understanding seasonal and temporal variations, and visualizing trends to inform environmental strategies.
 DATASET CONTENTS:-
 Time-series air quality data for Delhi including pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3, SO2, NH3, and AQI over various dates.
 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:-
Read the CSV file using Pandas.
Converted date columns to datetime format.
Checked for missing/null values and cleaned data where necessary.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-
Visualized pollutant levels over time.
Find correlation and plot Heatmap.
Identified seasonal variation.

4. Pollutant-Level Analysis:-
Analyzed and visualized key pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, NH3).
Monthly and daily averages of pollutants computed.
Used line plots to observe peaks and patterns.

4. Health Impact Categorization:-
Categorized AQI levels into health impact zones:
Good, Satisfactory, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, Severe, Hazardous.

5. Visualization:-
Bar charts and line graphs for pollutant trends.
Used Matplotlib and Seaborn
